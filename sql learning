🌱 Continuing My Learning Journey in Data Analytics

I may not have posted in a while, but my learning never stopped. Today, I proudly resume my journey — with a renewed spark!

🔍 I’ve come to realize the true power of SQL in data analytics.
It’s more than just a language — it’s the key to unlocking valuable insights from raw data.

🐍 Alongside SQL, I’ve also continued learning Python, which is helping me think logically, automate tasks, and explore data more deeply.

Whether it’s filtering data, writing conditional logic, or building visualizations — each step makes me more confident and curious.

🚀 I’m excited to keep going, practice consistently, and share my growth here.

Let’s learn, grow, and build together!
