📅 Date: June 11, 2025
🧠 Focus: Strengthening logic building through conditionals and loops in Python

✅ Assignments Completed Today:
🎯 Lesson 2.1: Conditional Statements
✔️ Simple if Statement – Check if a number is positive

✔️ if-else Statement – Check if number is positive or negative

✔️ if-elif-else Statement – Identify if number is positive, negative, or zero

✔️ Nested if Statement – Check if number is positive and even/odd or negative

🔁 Lesson 2.2: Loops
✔️ for Loop – Print numbers 1 to 10

✔️ while Loop – Same task using while

✔️ Nested Loops – Print 5x5 grid of *

✔️ break Statement – Keep summing numbers until user enters 0

✔️ continue Statement – Skip printing 5 from 1 to 10

✔️ pass Statement – Define an empty function

✔️ Combining Loops + Conditionals – Print even numbers from 1 to n

✔️ Factorial Calculation – Find factorial using while loop

✔️ Sum of Digits – Using while, add digits of a number

✔️ Prime Number Check – Check if input is prime

✔️ Fibonacci Sequence – Print first n Fibonacci numbers
